**GOOD DESIGN VS BAD DESIGN**

GOOD DESIGN:
Before Instagram's latest update, the app would notify the user once they had seen all new posts from people they followed. This was signified by the checkmark icon. While there may not have been much usefulness for this feature, it was a nice and subtle way of letting the user know that he/she/they was all caught up and did not need to scroll further.

**GOOD DESIGN VS BAD DESIGN**

GOOD DESIGN:
Before Instagram's latest update, the app would notify the user once they had seen all new posts from people they followed. This was signified by the checkmark icon. While there may not have been much usefulness for this feature, it was a nice and subtle way of letting the user know that he/she/they was all caught up and did not need to scroll further.

BAD DESIGN:
After the latest update, Instagram has changed the affordance of this "checkmark" to instead lead into suggested posts. To access older content, the user will now have to click the small block of text under the icon. This update not only messes with the muscle memory of longtime users, it is also incredibly redundant. What is different about these "suggested posts" that distinguishes it from the already existing "explore page" that is one swipe away? If the app developers are so insistent on this new homepage layout, I propose that they at least replace the explore page with a place to view older posts from a person's friends.
